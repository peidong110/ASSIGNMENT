     │                                                                         
     │  1. When you ran the generator it used your student number to           
     │ create a collection of faces and an image of the game board of        
     │ faces for playing the game. This image was saved in a file           
     │ called 'your-game-board.png'. Review this image carefully             
     │ because the branching control structures you develop for this         
     │ submission will reference the features in the faces of this        
     │ image, but please note that you are not including this file with     
     │ your submission.                                                  
     │                                                                   
     │  2. Download the assignment template from cuLearn, place it in          
     │ the same folder as 'your-game-board.png' and                       
     │ 'comp1405_f17_assistant_a4.py' (a file you extracted when you          
     │ extracted the generator). You must rename the assignment            
     │ template to 'comp1405_f17_#########_a4.py', replacing the              
     │ hashtags with your nine-digit student number. This file is the    
     │ only file you will submit.                                         
     │                                                                   
     │  3. The template for this assignment contains only a header and      
     │ one line of code. The 'from comp1405_f17_assistant_a4 import *'        
     │ instruction will give you access to two functions provided in      
     │ the 'comp1405_f17_assistant_a4.py' module. See the next item for   
     │ more details.                                                      
     │                                                                    
     │  4. You cannot use the print function or the input function when   
     │ completing this assignment. Instead, in order for your program     
     │ to interact with the player, you must use the ask_question and     
     │ make_a_guess functions that were imported from the                 
     │ 'comp1405_f17_assistant_a4.py' module. The ask_question function     
     │ takes a single string argument and returns a string; the           
     │ argument is the question that the computer wishes to ask and the   
     │ return value string is the response entered by the player. The    
     │ make_a_guess function takes a single string argument and has no    
     │ return value; the argument is what the computer has concluded          
     │ about the identity of the player. Review these functions           
     │ carefully but do not modify them in any way. Pay careful             
     │ attention to the possible values that could be returned by the      
     │ ask_question function.                                             
     │                                                                   
     │  5. Please note that for this variant the computer program is      
     │ only allowed to guess at the identity of the player once. In       
     │ other words, the computer program must be 100% certain about the        
     │ identity of the player before calling the make_a_guess function.   
     │ The computer program must also be able to identify the human         
     │ player in less than five guesses - if you review the features of   
     │ your assigned faces carefully, you should have no difficulty       
     │ coming up with the collection of questions the computer should      
     │ ask. In many ways, the submission you are preparing for this       
     │ assignment is very similar to the dichotomous key example that      
     │ was discussed in class.                                            
     │                                                                    
     │  6. In order for your submission to receive a mark, each of the    
     │ string arguments you provide to the ask_question function must      
     │ contain one and only one of the following words: ['earring',       
     │ 'eyepatch', 'glasses', 'hair', 'hat', 'moustache', 'pipe',         │     
     │ 'tattoo', 'tie']. The case does not matter, but exactly one of     
     │ these words must appear in your question, as these are the only    
     │ features that can be used to uniquely identify one of the          
     │ cartoon faces. As a clarifying example, the string 'Are you        
     │ wearing a hat?' would be a valid question, but the string 'Does    
     │ your name start with the letter A?' would be an invalid            
     │ question. If your submission uses any invalid questions you will   
     │ receive a mark of zero.                                            
     │                                                                   
     │  7. Similarly, each of the string arguments you provide to the     
     │ make_a_guess function must contain one and only one of the names        
     │ that appears on your game board. Once again, although the case     
     │ does not matter, if any of your calls to the make_a_guess          
     │ function are passed an argument that does not contain one (and          
     │ only one) of the names that you have been assigned, your                
     │ submission will receive a mark of zero.                             
     │                                                                      
     │  8. Do not use the input or print functions in your submission.      
     │ The only functions you are permitted in this assignment are           
     │ upper, lower, ask_question, and make_a_guess. If your submission     
     │ calls any other function you will receive a mark of zero.            
     │                                                                      
     │  9. The only module you are allowed to import is already               
     │ imported for you (i.e., 'comp1405_f17_assistant_a4.py'). Do not         
     │ make any additional imports - if you do, then you will receive a        
     │ mark of zero.                                                           
     │                                                                        
     │ 10. Close the pygame window to terminate this generator.               
     │
